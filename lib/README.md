# Project 3: Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

See the functions.R for the compilation of all functions used in the main.Rmd. For individual function scripts, see the folder "other functions."
