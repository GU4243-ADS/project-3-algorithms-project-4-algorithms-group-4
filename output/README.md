# Project 3: Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation
### Output folder

The output directory contains the output from our various model, including simularity weights and predictions from the memory based model. There is a separate subfolder for prediction results from the Model-based approach.  The Model-based predictions are titled in the format "pred.dataset.iterationnumber.clusternumber.RData", so for example "pred.ms.iter100.c5.RData"
